# Privacy Policy – CSS Inspector Lite

**Effective Date:** December 17, 2025

CSS Inspector Lite (“we,” “our,” or “the Extension”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data. By using CSS Inspector Lite, you agree to the practices described here.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

CSS Inspector Lite is designed to help users inspect CSS, HTML IDs, and classes on websites. The extension does **not require user accounts** or personal identification information to function. However, certain information may be collected locally in your browser to improve your experience:

- **Local Storage Data:**  
  - Pro status (`pro`) to manage access to premium features.  
  - Last inspected CSS and user settings (e.g., UI preferences, toggle states).  
- **Extension Usage Data (Optional):**  
  - Interaction with the extension’s interface (e.g., which elements are inspected).  
  - No browsing history or personal website content is sent to our servers.

> **Note:** CSS Inspector Lite runs entirely locally and does not transmit any inspected HTML, CSS, or website data to external servers.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Data stored locally is used exclusively for:

- Enabling or disabling Pro features.  
- Restoring your settings and last inspected elements.  
- Improving the extension’s UI/UX based on usage patterns.

No personal information is sold, shared, or used for advertising purposes.

---

## 3. Cookies and Tracking

CSS Inspector Lite does **not use cookies** or third-party tracking scripts. All storage occurs locally in your browser.

---

## 4. Data Security

Your data is stored locally in your Chrome browser’s storage:

- Only accessible by the extension itself.  
- Not transmitted over the internet.  
- Protected by your browser’s built-in security.

Despite these measures, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. Use the extension at your own discretion.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

CSS Inspector Lite does not integrate with or send data to third-party services. Any future updates that add third-party integrations will include clear disclosure.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

CSS Inspector Lite is **not intended for children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Since the extension does not collect personal data beyond local storage:

- You can clear your browser’s local storage to remove all saved settings and Pro status.  
- You can uninstall the extension at any time, which removes all locally stored data.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes to the extension or legal requirements. Updates will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
